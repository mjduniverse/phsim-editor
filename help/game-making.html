<h1>Making a Game</h1>

<p>Games could be made in the PhSim editor. When this is done, the simulations are treated as levels. Here are the instructions:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Go to the "Edit" menu</li>
    <li>Click on "Simulation Settings"</li>
    <li>Go to the "Game Settings" tab</li>
    <li>Click on "Enable Game"</li>
</ol>

After doing this, there is a panel that contains three fields:

<ul>
    <li>Inital Score: The score the game starts at</li>
    <li>Goal: The Score that makes one advance levels</li>
    <li>Life: The life that it starts at</li>
</ul>

When the desired values have been entered, you can just close the Object Editor.

To add a player, one just needs to do the following:

<ol>
    <li>Create an object</li>
    <li>Right click on object</li>
    <li>Go to main settings</li>
    <li>Add at least one sensor class.</li>
    <li>Close the Object Editor</li>
</ol>

To add game health, hazards or coins do the following (please note this only works if the game has been enabled):

<ol>
    <li>Create an object</li>
    <li>Right click on object</li>
    <li>Open Object Editor</li>
    <li>Go to "Widgets" tab</li>
    <li>Click on dropdown menu</li>
    <li>Click on either "Hazard", "Coin" or "Health"</li>
    <li>Click on "Add Widget"</li>
    <li>Go to the "Main Settings" tab</li> 
    <li>Add a censor class that is shared with the player object<li>
</ol>
